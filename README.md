Scala framework for neural networks

This is a framework for testing and learning neural network architectures in scala. The main goal is to help myself learn scala so this will be an evolving project that will hopefully use the language to its full abilities. Over time I hope this will become a useful and robust framework for others to use and learn about neural networks.
